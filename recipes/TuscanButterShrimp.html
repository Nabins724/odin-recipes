        <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>2 ounces Parmesan cheese, grated, plus more for garnish</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps: </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Step 1: </li>
        <p>Gather all ingredients.</p>

        <li>Step 2: </li>
        <p>Toss shrimp with salt and pepper in a large bowl until well combined. Heat a large high-sided skillet over
            medium heat. Add 1 tablespoon butter and 1 tablespoon sun-dried tomato oil; heat until shimmering, about 2
            minutes. Add shrimp in an even layer, and cook until opaque and pink, 3 to 4 minutes, flipping shrimp
            halfway through cooking time. Transfer shrimp to a large plate.</p>

        <li>Step 3: </li>
        <p>Melt remaining 1 tablespoon butter with remaining 1 tablespoon sun-dried tomato oil in the same skillet; stir
            in cherry tomatoes, shallot, garlic, and sun-dried tomatoes. Cook, stirring occasionally, until tomatoes are
            soft and shallot is translucent, about 4 minutes.</p>

        <li>Step 4: </li>
        <p>Stir spinach, basil, wine, lemon zest, and crushed red pepper into mixture in skillet; cook over medium,
            scraping up any browned bits from bottom of skillet, until wine mixture is reduced by half, about 2 minutes.
            Stir in heavy cream. Reduce heat to low, and add Parmesan cheese; cook, stirring constantly, until mixture
            is slightly thickened and simmering, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat.</p>

        <li>Step 5: </li>
        <p>Stir in lemon juice; add cooked shrimp along with any juices from plate. Garnish with additional basil and
            Parmesan cheese.</p>


    </ul>

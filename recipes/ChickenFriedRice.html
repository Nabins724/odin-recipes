    <h2>Description:</h1>
    <p>This is a quick and easy recipe for chicken fried rice that I make when I have leftover 
        roast chicken and cooked rice. I add some veggies and a few pantry staple spices for a 
        flavorful family dinner that's perfect when you're short on time and groceries!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients: </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon canola oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sesame oil</li>
        <li>1/3 cup diced carrots</li>
        <li>1/4 sliced green onions, white and lighter green parts</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
        <li>3 cups cold cooked rice</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded cooked chicken</li>
        <li>1/2 cup frozen Peas</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons rice vinegar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons Sriracha mayonnaise, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sliced green onions, or to taste</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Steps: </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Step 1: </li>
        <p>Heat canola and sesame oils in a large, nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. 
            Add carrot and 1/4 cup green onion; cook, stirring constantly, for 1 minute. 
            Stir in garlic powder and ginger and cook for 2 minutes. Stir in rice, salt, and 
            pepper; cook, stirring only once or twice, until rice is lightly browned, about 4 
            to 5 minutes. Stir in chicken and peas; cook for 2 minutes.</p>

        <li>Step 2: </li>
        <p>Push rice mixture to the sides of the pan, creating a circle in the middle. 
            Add butter to the center of the pan. When melted, pour eggs into the center. 
            Cook eggs, stirring often, until almost set, about 3 minutes. Stir eggs into 
            the rice mixture. Stir in soy sauce and rice vinegar; cook for 2 more minutes.</p>

        <li>Step 3: </li>
        <p>Serve immediately topped with Sriracha mayo and green onions.</p>
    </ul>

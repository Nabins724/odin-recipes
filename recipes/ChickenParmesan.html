        Parmesan-coated chicken swimming in a pool of pasta and sauce with a blanket of melted shredded Italian-blend cheese.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients: </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>6 chicken breast tenderloins</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon half and half</li>
        <li>1 cup seasoned bread crumbs</li>
        <li>1/2 cup panko bread crumbs</li>
        <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced fresh flat-leaf parsley</li>
        <li>2 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>3 quarts water</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon salth</li>
        <li>6 ounces angle hair pasta</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups prepared marinara sauce</li>
        <li>3 ounces shredded italian cheese blend</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Steps: </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Step 1: </li>
        <p>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease a large baking dish.</p>
        
        <li>Step 2: </li>
        <p>Combine flour, 1/2 teaspoon salt, garlic powder, black pepper, and cayenne pepper in a 
            resealable plastic bag. Place chicken tenderloins into flour mixture, seal the bag, and shake to coat.</p>
        
        <li>Step 3: </li>
        <p>Beat egg and half-and-half thoroughly in a shallow bowl. Mix together bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, 
            and parsley in a second shallow bowl. Dip floured chicken tenderloins into beaten egg mixture, 
            let excess egg drip off, then press chicken into bread crumb mixture to coat. Let breaded chicken 
            rest on a plate to set coating, about 10 minutes.</p>
        
        <li>Step 4: </li>
        <p>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook chicken in hot oil until no longer 
            pink in the center, the juices run clear, and coating is golden brown, about 5 minutes per side. 
            An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</p>
        
        <li>Step 5: </li>
        <p>Bring water and 1 tablespoon salt to a boil in a large pot. Cook angel hair pasta in boiling water, 
            stirring occasionally, until cooked through, about 5 minutes. Drain.</p>
        
        <li>Step 6: </li>
        <p>Pour 3/4 cup marinara sauce into the prepared baking dish and top with cooked pasta. 
            Pour remaining 3/4 cup sauce over pasta and arrange chicken tenderloins on top. 
            Sprinkle with Italian cheese blend.</p>
        
        <li>Step 7: </li>
        <p>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and bubbling, about 10 minutes.</p>
    </ul>
